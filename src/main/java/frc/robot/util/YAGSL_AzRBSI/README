This directory contains modified versions of various routines from the YAGSL
library (https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL).  The purpose of the modified
routines is to allow access to the CRTE Phoenix Pro features on supported
devices from within YAGSL -- which otherwise ignores Phoenix Pro.

Since the Az-RBSI is designed around a CTRE/SDS swerve base, yet we wish to
make use of the features of the YAGSL, it is necessary to extend these
particular routines to allow for Phoenix Pro features (if enabled / licensed).

NOTE for developers: it will be necessary, from time to time, to merge in any
modifications to these files from the main YAGSL repo to maintain compliant
functionality with the remainder of YAGSL.
