# Az-RBSI Installation Instructions

The Az-RBSI is available as a [Template Repository](
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for teams to use for creating their own 2025 FRC robot code.  These instructions
assume that [you](
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github)
and/or [your team](
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#organization-accounts)
already have a GitHub account where you will store your 2025 FRC robot code.

### Creating a 2025 FRC project from the Az-RBSI Template

From the [Az-RBSI GiuHub page](https://github.com/AZ-First/Az-RBSI/), click the "Use this template" button in the upper right corner of the page.

In the page that opens, select the Owner (most likely your team's account) and
Repository name (*e.g.*, "FRC-2025" or whatever your team's naming convention
is) into which the create the new robot project.  Optionally, include a
description of the repository for your reference.  Select "public" or "private"
repository based on the usual practices of your team.

The latest release of Az-RBSI is in the `main` (default) branch, so it is
recommended to **not** select the "Include all branches" checkbox.
